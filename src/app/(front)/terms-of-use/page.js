                <h3>8. Placing an Order</h3>
                <h3>A. Order Acceptance and Billing</h3>
                <p>
                  You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any
                  payment method provided to us. By providing payment information,
                  you authorize Sellora to use the payment method for purchases
                  made through the Sellora Services. All billing information must
                  be truthful and accurate. Sellora reserves the right to refuse
                  or cancel an order for any reason, including inaccuracies or
                  fraud. If your order is canceled after payment, we will issue a
                  credit to your payment method. Sellora may request
                  pre-authorization for some orders, which may be held by your
                  card issuer temporarily.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By confirming your purchase, you agree to accept and pay for the
                  Products, as well as applicable shipping, handling, taxes, and
                  fees. You will not be charged until the order has shipped,
                  except for orders paid with gift cards or digital wallets, which
                  are charged at the time of order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sellora may limit the quantity of items purchased per person or
                  order and prohibit sales to resellers. “Reselling” means
                  purchasing Products from Sellora for commercial sale to a third
                  party.
                </p>
                <h3>B. Pricing Information; Availability</h3>
                <p>
                  Sellora cannot confirm the price or availability of an item
                  until after your order is placed. Pricing or availability errors
                  may occur. Receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute
                  acceptance of an order. Sellora may cancel orders with pricing
                  or availability errors, even after confirmation, and notify you
                  of such cancellation.
                </p>
                <h3>C. Promotional Codes</h3>
                <p>
                  Promotional codes are limited, may expire without notice, and
                  are void where prohibited. They are not redeemable for cash and
                  are subject to cancellation or change at Sellora’s discretion.
                </p>
                <h3>D. Gift Cards</h3>
                <p>
                  Your purchase and use of gift cards are subject to Sellora’s
                  gift card terms, available at sellora.com/gift-cards.
                </p>
                <h3>9. Shipping and Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                  Products will be shipped to the address you designate, subject
                  to shipping restrictions on sellora.com. Risk of loss and title
                  pass to you upon delivery to the carrier. Delivery outside the
                  United States may be limited. Estimated delivery times depend on
                  the shipping method and destination.
                </p>
                <h3>10. Export Policy</h3>
