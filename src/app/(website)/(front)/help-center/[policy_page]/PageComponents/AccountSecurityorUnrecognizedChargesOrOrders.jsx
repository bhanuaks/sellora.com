      At Sellora, we prioritize the security of your account and personal
      information. Follow these guidelines to keep your account safe and address
      any concerns about unrecognized activity.
    </p>
    <h2>Stay Vigilant Against Suspicious Activity</h2>
    <p>
      Avoid opening suspicious emails or clicking on links they may contain. If
      you receive an email claiming to be from Sellora that seems unusual, do
      not engage with it. Instead, contact our support team directly via the{" "}
      <strong>Chat with Us</strong> button on Sellora.com.
    </p>
    <h2>Unrecognized Charges or Orders</h2>
    <p>
      If you notice a charge from Sellora.com on your bank or credit card
      statement that you don’t recognize, your payment method may have been
      compromised. For immediate assistance, select the Chat with Us button on
      Sellora.com and type "Unrecognized Charges" in the chat window.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps to Take for Unrecognized Charges or Orders</h2>
    <ul className="list_3">
      <li>
        <strong>Contact Your Financial Institution:</strong> Reach out to your
        bank or credit card provider immediately to report unauthorized charges
        and dispute them. Your financial institution is best equipped to help
        recover funds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reset Your Password:</strong> Log in to your Sellora account and
        update your password to a new, secure one. Ensure it’s at least 8
        characters long, with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, and
        includes a number or special character.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove Saved Payment Methods:</strong> Delete any saved credit
        card or payment information from your Sellora account to prevent further
        unauthorized use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure Other Accounts:</strong> If you use the same email and
        password combination for other websites or services, update those
        passwords immediately to protect your broader online presence.{" "}
