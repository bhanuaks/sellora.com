      At Sellora, we strive to deliver your orders efficiently, but multiple
      item orders may have unique handling. Here’s what you need to know:
    </p>
    <h2>Multiple Item Order Details</h2>
    <ul className="list_3">
      <li>
        <strong>Shipped from Multiple Locations:</strong> Your items may be
        dispatched from different Sellora fulfillment centers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Separate Arrivals:</strong> Items may arrive in separate
        packages, each with its own tracking number.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Track Your Order:</strong> Visit your Purchase History on
        Sellora.com to check if your order has been split into multiple
        packages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Missing Items?:</strong> If you’ve received all packages but are
        still missing items, contact our support team via the Chat with Us
        button on Sellora.com.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Deliveries from Sellora Fulfillment Centers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Out-of-Stock or Replaced Items:</strong> Review your email
        receipt to see if an item was out of stock or substituted. If you were
        charged for a missing item, reach out using the Chat with Us button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Missing Entire Order?:</strong> Check the delivery confirmation
        photo sent via email. Does the location (e.g., door or porch) look
        familiar?
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Incorrect Delivery Location:</strong> If the photo shows an
            unfamiliar location, verify your address on Sellora.com. You can
            also cross-check it on Google Maps to ensure the location marker is
            accurate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Still Can’t Find Your Package?:</strong> Contact our
            Customer Support team via the Chat with Us button on Sellora.com for
            assistance.
