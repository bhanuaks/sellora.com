        these steps to locate your package or resolve the issue with Sellora.
      </p>
      <h2>For Shipped Orders</h2>
      <p>
        If your Purchase History on Sellora.com indicates your package was
        delivered but it’s missing:
      </p>
      <ul className="list_3">
        <li>
          <strong>Inspect the Drop-Off Area:</strong> Check around the delivery
          location, such as porches, mailboxes, or side entrances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review Delivery Confirmation:</strong> Look at the delivery
          details in your <strong>Purchase History</strong> for any notes or
          photos provided by the carrier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask Around:</strong> Check with household members or neighbors
          to see if they received or moved the package.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify Your Address:</strong> Ensure the address in your Sellora
          account is correct, with no typos in spelling, street numbers, or
          apartment details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wait Two Business Days:</strong> Occasionally, carriers mark
          packages as delivered before they arrive. Allow two business days for
          the package to appear.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>

          can’t locate it:
        </p>
        <li>
          <strong>Check the Delivery Photo:</strong> Review the delivery
          confirmation photo sent via email or in your Purchase History. Does the
          door, porch, or location look familiar?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wrong Location?:</strong> If the photo shows an unfamiliar
          place, verify your address on Sellora.com. You can also check it on
          Google Maps to ensure the location pin is accurate.
