    <h2>Order Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>
      At Sellora, we aim to provide a seamless shopping experience. However, we
      understand that customers may wish to cancel an order. The following
      outlines our cancellation policy:
    </p>
    <h2>Customer-Initiated Cancellations</h2>
    <p>
      Before Dispatch: Orders can be canceled at any time before they are
      dispatched from our warehouse. After Dispatch: Once the order is out for
      delivery, it cannot be canceled. However, customers may choose to reject
      the delivery at the doorstep. Time-Sensitive Categories: The cancellation
      window may vary depending on the product category. Specific timeframes
      mentioned on the product or order confirmation page shall be considered
      final. Cancellation Charges: In some cases, post the cancellation window,
      a nominal cancellation fee may apply.
    </p>
    <h2>Seller-Initiated Cancellations</h2>
    <p>
      In the rare event that an order is canceled by the seller due to
      unforeseen circumstances such as stock unavailability or logistical
      constraints, a full refund will be processed for all prepaid orders.
    </p>
    <h2>Hyperlocal (MINUTES Delivery) Orders</h2>
    <p>
      Orders placed under the ‘MINUTES Delivery’ category are typically
      non-cancellable and non- refundable through the self-service option, due
      to rapid dispatch and delivery timelines. However cancellation or refunds
      may be granted under the following circumstances by contacting customer
      support:
    </p>
    <p>The order was not delivered within the estimated time;</p>
    <p>The order was not picked up by the delivery agent;</p>
    <p>The seller did not accept or canceled the order;</p>
    <p>Any other valid reason as determined by Sellora.</p>
    <p>Sellora’s Right to Cancel</p>
    <h2>
      Sellora reserves the right to cancel orders in part or in full due to:
    </h2>
    <p>Product unavailability;</p>
    <p>Fraud detection or prevention;</p>
    <p>Violation of our Terms of Use;</p>
    <p>Force majeure or unforeseen logistical issues.</p>
    <p>
      In such cases, customers will not be charged for the canceled portion and
      a refund will be issued within 5 –10business days. Refund tracking is
      available under the ‘Order Details’ section on the platform.
